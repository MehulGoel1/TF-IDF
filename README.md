# TF-IDF
The TF-IDF technique can be used to compute similarity among a data set of documents and can be used as a basis of 
recommendation to the reader. The technoque is called term-frequence inverse document frequency, the tf-idf scoe for each 
stem word in the corpus is calculated the score is direcectly proportinal to the frquency of the word in that document and inversely
propotional to the frequency of the word in corpus. The TF-IDF values are calculated for each of the document and then the 
documents are compared based on their TF_IDF score.
